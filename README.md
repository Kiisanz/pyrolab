# 🔥 PyroLab - Virtual Pyrolysis Lab (Python)

**PyroLab** is a Python-based virtual laboratory that simulates the **plastic pyrolysis process** — a thermal decomposition technique that converts plastic waste into fuel or gas.  
This project is developed for **educational and non-commercial research** purposes, offering a simple and intuitive way to study the science behind pyrolysis.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧪 Simulate pyrolysis behavior of various plastic types
- 📊 Generate plots of temperature, yield, and reaction time
- 🧠 Educational use for environmental science, chemistry, and engineering
- ⚙️ Built with Python and scientific libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib)



## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kiisanz/pyrolab.git
cd pyrolab
````

### 2. Set up the environment

We recommend using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the simulation

```bash
python main.py
```
